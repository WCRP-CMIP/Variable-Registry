    "description": "Mole fraction is used in the construction \"mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y\", where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as \"nitrogen\" or a phrase such as \"nox_expressed_as_nitrogen\". Acetone is an organic molecule with the chemical formula CH3CH3CO. The IUPAC name for acetone is propan-2-one. Acetone is a member of the group of organic compounds known as ketones. There are standard names for the ketone group as well as for some of the individual species.",
