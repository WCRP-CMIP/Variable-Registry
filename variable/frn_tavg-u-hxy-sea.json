    "description": "\"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase. 'Denitrification' is the conversion of nitrate into gaseous compounds such as nitric oxide, nitrous oxide and molecular nitrogen which are then emitted to the atmosphere.  'Sedimentation' is the sinking of particulate matter to the floor of a body of water. \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time.",
