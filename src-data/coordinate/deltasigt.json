It is the depth at which density is larger than the density of the first model level+ a threshold of 0.03 kg.m-3 (appendix H24). For CMIP7, we propose to make the reference depth 10 m instead of the first model level (note than some modelling groups already did it that way for CMIP6). A recent study based on OMIP (Treguier et al. 2023, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3849-2023 )discusses the fact that using the first model level as a reference makes mlotst less comparable with obs (obs-based datasets reference the MLD to 10m because the diurnal cycle is not well-sampled by observations). Furthermore, the difference of the depth of the first model level between different models makes a significant difference in the computed MLDs in some seasons/regions (Treguier et al., 2023).",
