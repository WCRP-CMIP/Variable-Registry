    "description": "Mole fraction is used in the construction mole_fraction_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. The chemical formula for HCFC22 is CHClF2.  The IUPAC name for HCFC22 is chloro-difluoro-methane.",
