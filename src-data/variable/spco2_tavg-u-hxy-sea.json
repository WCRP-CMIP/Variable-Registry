    "description": "The surface called \"surface\" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The partial pressure of a dissolved gas in sea water is the partial pressure in air with which it would be in equilibrium. The partial pressure of a gaseous constituent of air is the pressure which it alone would exert with unchanged temperature and number of moles per unit volume. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2.",
