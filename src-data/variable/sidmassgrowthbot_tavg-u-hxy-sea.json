    "description": "Rate of change of sea-ice mass due to vertical growth of existing sea ice at its base divided by grid-cell area. Note that this number is always positive or zero since sea-ice melt is collected in sidmassmeltbot. This is to account for differential growth and melt in models with a sub-grid scale ice thickness distribution.",
