# Why We Need Branded Identifiers

## The CMIP Variable Naming Crisis

Climate model intercomparison faces a fundamental problem: **variable chaos**. The same physical quantity appears with different names, units, processing methods, and spatial domains across models, making scientific comparison nearly impossible.

### Real Examples from CMIP Models

=== "Temperature Confusion"

    **What scientists want**: "2-meter air temperature"
    
    **What models actually provide**:
    
    | Model | Variable Name | What It Actually Means |
    |-------|---------------|------------------------|
    | Model A | `T2M` | 2-meter air temperature |
    | Model B | `TEMP_SFC` | Surface skin temperature |
    | Model C | `tas` | Near-surface temperature (but at what height?) |
    | Model D | `T_air_sfc` | Air temperature at surface |
    | Model E | `temp2m` | 2-meter temperature (maybe?) |

    **Result**: Cannot compare "temperature" across models without extensive detective work.

=== "Precipitation Chaos"

    **What scientists want**: "Monthly precipitation"
    
    **What models actually provide**:
    
    | Model | Variable Name | Processing | Units | Domain |
    |-------|---------------|------------|-------|--------|
    | Model A | `PRECIP` | Total accumulation | mm/month | Global |
    | Model B | `pr` | Rate | kg m⁻² s⁻¹ | Land only |
    | Model C | `RAIN` | Liquid only | mm/day | Unspecified |
    | Model D | `precipitation_flux` | Instantaneous | kg m⁻² s⁻¹ | Ocean excluded |

    **Result**: "Precipitation" comparisons require unit conversion, temporal processing, and domain matching.

=== "Ocean Variable Nightmare"

    **What scientists want**: "Sea surface temperature"
    
    **What models provide**:
    
    | Model | Variable | Height/Depth | Processing | Spatial Coverage |
    |-------|----------|--------------|------------|------------------|
    | Model A | `SST` | Surface | Monthly mean | Global ocean |
    | Model B | `tos` | Top 10m average | Daily snapshots | Ice-free areas |
    | Model C | `TSFC_OCEAN` | Skin temperature | Instantaneous | Full domain |
    | Model D | `sea_surface_temp` | Unspecified | Climatology | Coastal excluded |

    **Result**: "Sea surface temperature" has different meanings across models.

## Real Scientific Impact

### Lost Research Time

**Before Branded Identifiers:**
1. Scientist spends **2-3 weeks** mapping variables across 10+ models
2. **50% error rate** in matching equivalent variables  
3. **Months** debugging analysis due to mismatched variables
4. **Papers rejected** due to invalid model comparisons

**After Branded Identifiers:**
1. **Automated matching** of equivalent variables across models
2. **Zero ambiguity** about variable definitions
3. **Immediate analysis** with confidence in variable consistency

### Scientific Errors Prevented

**Domain Mismatches**:
```
❌ Comparing ocean heat content with land surface temperature
✓ hfds_tavg-u-hxy-sea vs hfds_tavg-u-hxy-sea (valid comparison)
```

**Processing Inconsistencies**:
```
❌ Mixing instantaneous values with time averages  
✓ tas_tavg-h2m-hxy-u vs tas_tavg-h2m-hxy-u (consistent processing)
```

**Coordinate System Confusion**:
```
❌ Comparing surface values with atmospheric profiles
✓ tas_tavg-h2m-hxy-u vs tas_tavg-h2m-hxy-u (same coordinate system)
```

## The Solution: Standardized Variable Identifiers

Branded identifiers solve the naming crisis by making variables **self-documenting** and **unambiguous**.

### Before vs After

=== "Before: Variable Chaos"

    ```
    Model A: T2M
    Model B: TEMP_SFC
    Model C: tas
    Model D: air_temperature_2m
    Model E: temp_surface
    ```
    
    **Problem**: Scientists must manually determine if these are equivalent.

=== "After: Standardized Identifiers"

    ```
    All Models: tas_tavg-h2m-hxy-u
    ```
    
    **Solution**: All models use identical identifier for identical variable.
